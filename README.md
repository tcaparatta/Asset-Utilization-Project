# Asset Utilization Project

An exploratory data science project analyzing asset utilization patterns in an unlabeled asset dataset. The goal is to assess long-term performance and cost impact when high-usage assets are retained beyond their typical lifecycle.

> ⚠️ All data in this repository is randomly generated and anonymized. The methods and insights, however, are applicable to many operational assets across various industries.

## 📌 Overview

Many operational assets serve multiple usage roles. For this study, we consider two general task types:

- **Task A**: High-usage operations typically requiring newer, more reliable assets.
- **Task B**: Lower-usage operations, often assigned to older or less critical units.

This project analyzes a group of assets with **no explicit labeling** of asset roles. The aim is to use clustering and predictive modeling to infer operational patterns and assess the impact of **not retiring high-usage units**, even when exceeding the typical usage threshold of **750,000**.

> Assets operating beyond this threshold tend to incur significantly higher maintenance costs, which will be modeled in the final analysis.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Automatically infer asset roles using unsupervised learning
- Forecast next-year usage by task type
- Quantify cost implications of exceeding standard usage thresholds
- Provide a reusable and scalable analysis pipeline

## 🧪 Project Steps

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   Prepare and validate raw asset usage data.

2. **Role Inference**  
   Apply **K-Means Clustering** to classify assets into Task A and Task B based on behavioral patterns.

3. **Segmentation**  
   Organize assets into operational role groups for analysis.

4. **Forecasting (Task A)**  
   Use **Linear Regression** to estimate future mileage for Task A assets, which typically follow consistent usage trends.

5. **Forecasting (Task B)**  
   Use **median-based projection** for Task B assets, reflecting more variable and less predictable usage.

6. **Cost Analysis**  
   Identify assets exceeding 750k miles and estimate increased maintenance costs.
